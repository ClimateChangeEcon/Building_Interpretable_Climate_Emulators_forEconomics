## What is in the folder

This folder contains the solutions for each model used in the paper. The solutions for each model are stored in the respective folder (you can read about names of the folders here). 

Solution represts a pretrained network that can be used for postprocessing as well as the *.csv files containing the postprocessing results.

The *.csv files with the results are used for building replication figures for the Section 4.

## IMPORTANT!

Due to the large size of the pretrained solutions, solutions of the following models are sotred as *.tar.gz archive:

- **cdice_3sr_pi_climber_opt**
- **cdice_4pr_pi_climber_opt**
- **cdice_4pr_pi_mesmo_opt**
- **cdice_4prx_pi_psi2_opt**

* To unarchive respective solutions please follow:

```tar -zxvf XXX.tar.gz```
where XXX stands for the name of the archive.
