\caption{Damages, expressed as \( \tilde{D}(T_{2100}^{\text{z}})/\tilde{D}(T_{\text{Baseline}}^{\text{z}}) - 1 \), assuming a global-mean warming of 2.65 °C since pre-industrial times ($\approx$ 1.55 °C since 2015) under the 4PR-X scenario. Absolute temperatures stem from ERA5 (\(T_{\text{abs,c}}^{\text{z}}\)); pattern factors \( \beta^{\text{z}} \) are taken from MPI-ESM-LR (left) or HadGEM2-ES (right). Red (blue) colors indicate an increase (decrease) in TFP due to global warming by 2100. }
