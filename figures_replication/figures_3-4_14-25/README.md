# Climate Emulator Repository

This folder contains Python scripts for building, fitting, and visualizing climate emulators based on the framework described in the paper. The workflow is designed for Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) practitioners to create interpretable and efficient carbon cycle emulators. 

To run the full pipeline:
```bash
$ sh run_all.sh
```

The folder ```result/``` contains all solved models, including those referenced in the paper. If users still wish to execute the solver, it can be done for a 250-year timespan under Preindustrial (PI) and Present-Day (PD) conditions for MMM, CLIMBER2, and MESMO. This is handled automatically by ```$ sh run_all.sh```. To excite the solver explicitly, simply rename the existing ```result/``` folder (e.g., to ```result_bk```) and execute ```$ sh run_all.sh```, which runs:
```bash
$ python3 solver.py PI 250 MMM
$ python3 solver.py PD 250 MMM
$ python3 solver.py PI 250 MESMO 
$ python3 solver.py PD 250 MESMO
$ python3 solver.py PI 250 CLIMBER2  
$ python3 solver.py PD 250 CLIMBER2
```
__NOTICE: Non-convex optimization solved via differential evolution; minor (<1%) stochastic variability may occur._

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `solver.py`

**Purpose:** Fits the 3SR and 4PR carbon cycle models to benchmark datasets, performing a grid search over penalty parameters.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 solver.py <conditions: PI|PD> <T:int> <benchmark_sel>
```

* **PI**: Preindustrial benchmark set
* **PD**: Present-day benchmark set
* `<T>`: Time horizon in years
* `<benchmark_sel>`: One benchmark model name from the allowed set for the selected condition

**Example:**

```bash
python3 solver.py PD 250 CLIMBER2
```

Each folder contains:

* `opt.log`: Optimization log
* `result.pkl`: Fitted model parameters and metadata
* `opt_data.pkl`: Objective and penalty term histories

---

### 2. `fig_benchmark_pulse.py`

**Purpose:** Plots benchmark impulse response (pulse) data for selected models.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 fig_benchmark_pulse.py
```

This script will generate figures and save them in the `fig/` directory.

---

### 3. `fig_RCP_RF.py`

**Purpose:** Plots Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios and radiative forcing data.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 fig_RCP_RF.py
```

This script produces RCP emissions, cumulative emissions, COâ‚‚ forcing, and forcing ratio plots.

---

### 4. `fig_analysis.py`

**Purpose:** Performs post-fit analysis of emulator results.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 fig_analysis.py
```

Reads fit results from the output directories and generates performance/diagnostic plots.

---

### 5. `fig_sim.py`

**Purpose:** Runs and visualizes emulator simulations for different scenarios.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 fig_sim.py
```

Generates simulation figures for 3SR and 4PR configurations.
