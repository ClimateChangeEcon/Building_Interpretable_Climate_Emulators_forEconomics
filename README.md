### CMIP5 output data for Climate Emulator testing

Please note that the data described below is added to the data [folder](data/source) as source data as well as parts of it are split across different subfolders [concentration](data/concentration), [emission](data/emission), [forcing](data/forcing), [tempearture](data/temperature). Thus we do not describe each folder spearately, but just the source data.

For the calibration of the CE we use the benchmark data that was added to [this folder](data/source/DataFromCMIP).

The data are based on montly mean global mean surface temperature data from the CMIP5 archive, as downloaded on March 1, 2021, from http://iacweb.ethz.ch/staff/beyerleu/cmip5/. The site offers an easy to use mirror to the full CMIP5 archive at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip5/.

The monthly mean data have been aggregated to annual means using cdo (climate data operators, https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/).
The data comes in netcdf format. 


### CMIP5 input data, historical and RCPs

We used carbon emissions (GtC, fossile, other, total) and concentrations (CO2) as used in CMIP5 historical and RCP scenarios (see Taylor et al. (2012)). 

The data from Taylor et al. (2012) can be downloaded from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Reasearch from following [URL](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~mmalte/rcps/). Note that RCP3PD at PIK corresponds to RCP26. Likewise RCP6 at PIK corresponds to RCP60.

The following files contain annual carbon emissions from 1750 to 2500 for the different RCPs:

- RCP26_EMISSIONS.csv
- RCP45_EMISSIONS.csv
- RCP60_EMISSIONS.csv
- RCP85_EMISSIONS.csv

The following files contain annual mean CO2 concentrations from 1750 to 2500 for the different RCPs:

- RCP26_MIDYR_CONC.DAT
- RCP45_MIDYR_CONC.DAT
- RCP60_MIDYR_CONC.DAT
- RCP85_MIDYR_CONC.DAT

For simplicity, we added these datasets to this [folder](data/source/EmiAndConcData).

Additionally we used the land emissions data from Gasser et al. (2020). 

The follwoing file contains the data on land emissions:
- Gasser_et_al_2020_best_guess.nc

The data can be downloaded from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis from following [URL](https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/17551/). We added these dataset to this [folder](data/land_emission).

### Pulse

We used pulse data from Joos et al. (2013). 

The following files contain pre-processed timeseries of all the models under PD:
- IRF_PD100_SMOOTHED_AFCUM.dat
- IRF_PD100_SMOOTHED_CO2.dat
- IRF_PD100_SMOOTHED_FABCUM.dat
- IRF_PD100_SMOOTHED_FASCUM.dat
- IRF_PD100_SMOOTHED_OHC.dat
- IRF_PD100_SMOOTHED_SSLR.dat
- IRF_PD100_SMOOTHED_T.dat

The following files contain pre-processed timeseries of all the models under PI:
- IRF_PI100_SMOOTHED_AFCUM.dat
- IRF_PI100_SMOOTHED_CO2.dat
- IRF_PI100_SMOOTHED_FABCUM.dat
- IRF_PI100_SMOOTHED_FASCUM.dat
- IRF_PI100_SMOOTHED_OHC.dat
- IRF_PI100_SMOOTHED_SSLR.dat
- IRF_PI100_SMOOTHED_T.dat

The data can be downloaded from the University Bern from following [URL](https://climatehomes.unibe.ch/~joos/IRF_Intercomparison/results.html). 

For simplicity, we added these datasets to this [folder](data/pulse).

### Zero Emission Commitment

We used ZEC data from Jones et al. (2019) and Macdougall et al. (2020). 

The description can be found at the University of Victoria page [URL](https://terra.seos.uvic.ca/ZECMIP/) and the data can be downloaded from the following [URL](https://terra.seos.uvic.ca/ZECMIP/Data/). 

The list of the files with the data can be found [here](data/ZEC/files.txt). 

For simplicity, we added these datasets to this [folder](data/ZEC).

### Pattern scaling data
For pattern scaling we used three datasets.

First, we used the **IPCC AR6 WGI v4 reference regions** from Iturbide et al. (2020). The data can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS). 

Second, we used a **library of temperature and precipitation patterns** from this [repository](https://github.com/JGCRI/CMIP5_patterns/tree/master) from Lynch et al. (2017), Kravitz et al. (2016).

Third, we used **ERA5 data** for the global climate and weather. The data can be found at the page of Climate Data Store of Copernicus Climate Change Service [URL](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview).

For simplicity, we added these datasets to the following folders: 
- [folder](figures_replication/figure_9)
    - tas_climmean_era5_1991-2020_g025.nc
    - tas_climmean_HadGEM2-ES_minus_era5_1991-2020_g025.nc
    - tas_climmean_MPI-ESM-LR_minus_era5_1991-2020_g025.nc
    
- [folder](figures_replication/figure_10)
    - IPCC-WGI-reference-regions-v4_coordinates.csv
      
- [folder](figures_replication/figure_11)
    - PATTERN_tas_ANN_HadGEM2-ES_rcp85.nc
    - PATTERN_tas_ANN_MPI-ESM-LR_rcp85.nc
      
- [folder](figures_replication/figure_12)
    - ipcc_regions.csv
    - PATTERN_tas_ANN_HadGEM2-ES_rcp85.nc
    - PATTERN_tas_ANN_MPI-ESM-LR_rcp85.nc
    - tas_climmean_era5_1991-2020_g025.nc

- [folder](figures_replication/figure_32) (IPCC AR6 WGI v4 reference regions data). The list of the files with the data can be found [here](figures_replication/figure_32/files.txt). 

    
## Computational requirements

### Software requirements

The basic dependencies are tensorflow==2.3, hydra-core >= 1.1 and tensorboard (for monitoring).
For a full set of dependencies see the environment.yaml - this includes the development environment as well (Spyder 3).

* We provide implementations that use python 3.10.

* For the  The basic dependencies are [Tensorflow==2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [hydra](https://hydra.cc/) and [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) (for monitoring).

* The file ``requirements.txt`` lists the detailed dependencies. Please run "pip install -r requirements.txt" as the first step. See [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#ensuring-repeatability) for further instructions on creating and using the ``requirements.txt`` file.


### Controlled randomness

The random seed for our computations in *Section 4 - Numerical Experiments* is set at ``Building_Interpretable_Climate_Emulators_forEconomics/DEQN/config/config.yaml``, line 10.


### Memory and runtime requirements

* To solve one IAM model as discussed in *Section 4 - Numerical Experiments* until full convergence, it requires about 15 min on an ordinary laptop. All those models presented in the paper were solved using our [DEQN library](DEQN), which we ran on an 8-core Intel compute node on [https://nuvolos.cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud) with 64GB of RAM, and 100Gb of fast local storage (SSD).

* All the postprocessing codes (to produce the summary statistics, plots, and so forth) were run on an ordinary 4-core Intel-based laptop with Ubuntu version 18.04.5 LTS and consume typically few seconds to run.

* The approximate time needed to reproduce all the analyses for this paper on a standard (year 2025) desktop machine is 1-3 days of human time.


## Replication

* This section provides instructions on how to replicate the numerical results of the article. Note that in this readme, we only provide the basic steps to obtain the main results (e.g., for the multi-model mean of the CDICE model). Highly granular instructions on how to compute all the corner cases of the article are provided in readmes in the respective sub-folders.

* The optimal optimal order of running the computer code to replicate the results in article are as follows. 
  1. Run the instructions listed in the subsection ``1. Replication of Section 3: A Calibrated Climate Emulator``. This set of instructions will allow you to replicate the results of section 3 of the article. 
  2. Run the instructions listed in ``2. Replication of Section 4: Numerical Experiments``. This set of instructions will allow you to replicate the results of section 4 of the article. 
  3. Run the instructions listed in ``3. Replication of Section 5: Linking Global to Local Temperatures and Damages``. This set of instructions will allow you to replicate the results of section 5 of the article. 


### 1. Replication of Section 3: A Calibrated Climate Emulator

In this section, we provide the basic instructions on how to compute the results presented in section 3 of the article.

First, go to the following folder:

```
$ cd <PATH to the repository>Building_Interpretable_Climate_Emulators_forEconomics/figures_replication/figures_3-4_14-25
```
Script  `solver.py` fits the 3SR and 4PR carbon cycle models to benchmark datasets, performing a grid search over penalty parameters.
To run the fitting procedure please perfrom the following:
```bash
python3 solver.py <conditions: PI|PD> <T:int> <benchmark_sel>
```
* **PI**: Preindustrial benchmark set
* **PD**: Present-day benchmark set
* `<T>`: Time horizon in years
* `<benchmark_sel>`: One benchmark model name from the allowed set for the selected condition

For example,

```bash
python3 solver.py PD 250 CLIMBER2
```
Results form every model are stored in this [folder](figures_replication/figures_3-4_14-25/result).

* More details are provided in this general [readme](figures_replication/README.md) and [this readme](figures_replication/figures_3-4_14-25/README.md) that is specific to the section 3.


### 2. Replication of Section 4: Numerical Experiments

In this section, we provide the basic instructions on how to compute the results presented in section 4 of the article.

First, go to the following folder:

```
$ cd <PATH to the repository>Building_Interpretable_Climate_Emulators_forEconomics/figures_replication/figures_5-8_26-31
```

First, make sure you are at the root directory of DEQN by changing path to the following sub-directory:

```
$ cd <PATH to the repository>Building_Interpretable_Climate_Emulators_forEconomics/DEQN
```

To start the computation from scratch, change the specifications in the config file (config/config.yaml) to the particular model of interest while leaving the other entries untouched. The following entries will have to be adjusted:

```
defaults:
  - constants: cdice
  - net: cdice
  - optimizer: cdice
  - run:  cdice
  - variables:  cdice


MODEL_NAME:  XXX
```
XXX stands for the specific name of the model, the list of the models is presented [here](DEQN/README.md) .

Thereafter, execute:

```
python run_deepnet.py
```

To analyze the the raw results for the particular model solved, you need to perform two steps:

```
$ export USE_CONFIG_FROM_RUN_DIR=$ cd export USE_CONFIG_FROM_RUN_DIR=<PATH_TO_THE_FOLDER>/Building_Interpretable_Climate_Emulators_forEconomics/DEQN/runs/<MODEL_FOLDER>

$ python post_process_XXX.py STARTING_POINT=LATEST hydra.run.dir=$USE_CONFIG_FROM_RUN_DIR

```
where XXX stands for the postprocessing routine specific to the model.

For examplem, the setting for solving the 3SR model calibrated under PI for optimal mitigation **cdice_3sr_pi_opt** model is the following: 

```
  - constants: cdice
  - net: cdice
  - optimizer: cdice
  - run:  cdice
  - variables: cdice

MODEL_NAME:  cdice_3sr_pi_opt
```

To analyze this model, you need to run the following:

```
 export USE_CONFIG_FROM_RUN_DIR=<PATH_TO_THE_FOLDER>/Building_Interpretable_Climate_Emulators_forEconomics/DEQN/runs/cdice_3sr_pi_opt/3sr_pi_opt

python post_process_3sr.py STARTING_POINT=LATEST hydra.run.dir=$USE_CONFIG_FROM_RUN_DIR
```

To replicate the remaining results for individual models discussed in *Section 4 - Numerical Experiments*, the instructions given [here](DEQN/README.md).

* More details on the replication of the figures are provided in [this readme](figures_replication/README.md).


### 3. Replication of Section 5: Linking Global to Local Temperatures and Damages

In this section, we provide the basic instructions on how to compute the results presented in section 3 of the article.

First, go to the following folder:

```
$ cd <PATH to the repository>Building_Interpretable_Climate_Emulators_forEconomics/figures_replication
```

Folders `figure_9`, `figure_10`, `figure_11`, `figure_12`, `figure_13` contain all the scripts and data for replication of respective figures.

* More details are provided in [this readme](figures_replication/README.md).
